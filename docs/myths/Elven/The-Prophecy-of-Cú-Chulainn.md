Right after his birth, a prophecy was spoken by Corellon, The Protector, about a mythical hero who will come when the elves need him most. The name of this hero is Cú Chulainn and the prophecy goes as follows:

_When all hope be lost;_

_The sword from stone be drawn._

_Meneldur shall guide the Saviour,_

_and let tyranny be gone._

The Meneldur spoken of is the sword in the stone, which fell from the sky after Corellon had spoken the prophecy. The inscription on the sword reads as follows:

_He who draws this sword from stone;_

_Is rightwise Cú Chulainn, The Saviour born._

The first time Cú Chulainn was born was at the end of the Dragon War, where he was incarnated as a young forest elf. As predicted, he, with the help of some associates, brought about the end of the tyranny of the Queen of the Chromatic Dragons Tiamat by banishing her to the Nine Hells.
