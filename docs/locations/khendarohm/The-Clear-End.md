The Clear End is Khendarohm's middle-class district and houses most of the town's residents.
There are also some inns for travellers who don't have the money for the Miner Inn or are not rough enough to survive in the Stone Drunkard in the Stone Shade.

## The Broken Tap
This is Clear End's most prominent inn, as most do not have enough money for the Miner Inn or are not bleak enough for the [Stone Drunkard](./The-Stone-Shade.md#the-stone-drunkard), also the largest in town.

Most miners have their after-work drink there.
