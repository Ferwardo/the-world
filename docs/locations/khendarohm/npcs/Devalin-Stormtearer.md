The head of the Thieves Guild is a charismatic dwarf with a legendary moustache who is known throughout the city. Even though his guild is behind most illegal things in the city, he himself usually has an ‘alibi’ that means he has not yet been caught. He wears many rings and speaks with a Russian accent.
  
If the party doesn't antagonise him, he can sometimes have some assignments for them.
