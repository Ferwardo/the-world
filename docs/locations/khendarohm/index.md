# The City and Freestate of Khendarohm
_A large gate guards the entrance to the tunnel, which is itself guarded by towers and additional gates on the inside. After a kilometre comes the last gate and there is an overview of the city with four chimneys covering part of it in smog._

On one side of the main road leading down, the citadel stands in the middle of a beautifully built district. Closer to the entrance, we find middle-class houses in the Clear End.
Crossing the road, however, we find the Stone Shade, a dark district. Further by the mine entrance we find the Four Forges, where industry covers the buildings in smog."

The City of Khendarohm, or more officially the Free City and Protectorate of Khendarohm, is a mining town with an overwhelmingly dwarf population that has been building a great wealth under the mountain for about 2,000 years.
Deep below the city lie mines that could be mined in relative peace while others tried to take the city but no one has succeeded yet.

Originating from a small mining village, this city has grown into one of the most important cities in the High Kingdom of the Elves as the primary trading city of the west.
At the head of this operation are two people, the [mayor](./npcs/orsik-ironfist.md) who is in charge of all civil affairs such as trade and administration of the city, and the [battlemaster](./npcs/eridmik-smeltbrew.md) who, apart from defending the city, is also in charge of maintaining order.
