The Four Forges is named after the four giant blast furnaces built there.
Most of [Clear End's](./The-Clear-End.md) residents who do not work in the mines work there, converting the various ores into jewellery, weapons or just bars to sell in bulk. 
Most of the stuff is sold either at the [Dogfair](./The-Dogfair.md) or [Goldbringer's](./The-Old-District.md#goldbringers-bank).

Most of the district is permanently covered by smog from the smokestacks of the Forges that tower over the city.
