The city's market quarter, many shops and vendors can be found in the Dogfair. Ores, gems and other items of value are sold here after being processed in the Four Forges.

## Duncan's Magic Wares
Duncan's Magic Wares is operated by charimatic dwarf [Duncan Ironhalt](./npcs/ducan-ironhalt.md) and his shy assistant [Thia Liadon](./npcs/thia-liadon.md).
 This shop is one of the bigger in town because of the quasi monopoly Duncan has over the magic item trade, many standard items and custom enchantment services are offered.

## Madame Carmelia's Apothecary
The apothecary is an odd place where most want to be back outside as soon as possible and prefer to go only when necessary. The proprietress is [Madame Carmelia](./npcs/madame-carmelia.md), a weird dragonborn who sells the weirdest medicines you can find.
