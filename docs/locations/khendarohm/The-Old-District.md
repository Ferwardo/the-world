_The neighbourhood is full of the most extravagant buildings imaginable, though most look to have been built several decades or centuries ago. Several villas tower over their smaller siblings while several busy individuals move through the streets to their, probably well-paid, jobs._

The Old District is the city's oldest and wealthiest district as well as the city's starting point. Now, however, Khendarohm's elite live there and there are many high-end taverns and other establisments to entertain such persons.

Most wealthy families are found in this district.

## Goldbringer's bank
"A neo-classic building right next to the opera rises no higher than a single storey yet this is where most passage of people, elves and other creatures is found. For those looking to sell their loot at a far too low price, this is the place to be."

Goldbringer's is the city's largest bank and where most jewellery and other valuables as well as coins, all crafted in the Four Forges, find their way before being sold. The eponymous family runs this bank efficiently and, by their miserly personality perhaps, try to buy over all items at the lowest possible price.

## The Miner Inn
"A small building, one of the oldest in town, stands among the stately buildings. Not many visit but a few can still be found. When one enters, they find a beautiful interior and are greeted by an old woman who leads them to a free table."

The Miner Inn is the oldest inn in town and now services the city's well-to-do visitors. The adjacent restaurant is renowned for better cuisine.

[Khemnehulda Thundershoulder](./npcs/khemnehulda-thundershoulder.md), a somewhat aloof old dwarf, is the owner of the establishement and tries to take full care of her clientele and is quite a chatty woman after one gets to know her.
