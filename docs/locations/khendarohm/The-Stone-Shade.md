_Unlike across the main road, there is almost no lighting in the Stone Shade's alleys, which of course encourages crime. However, if one is not robbed down to his or her underwear, there is usually everything one could find in a black market._

The Stone Shade is the district where ordinary people prefer not to go, as it is the de facto territory of the thieves guild. Anyone not in the police or militia is likely to be robbed.

## The Fight Club
An underground club where most get their teeth kicked in but still a lot of money can be won if one is good enough.

## The Stone Drunkard
Located in the Stone Shade, this tavern is the centre of The Thieves Guild
and usually used as the place to seal the more shady deals. Few regular locals can be found here, most of the attendees are crooks and thieves who are only after the money of unsuspecting visitors.

## The Thieves Guild
The Thieves Guild, the only unregulated guild in town, which makes rather good sense with all the crime they commit, is run by Devalin Stormtearer
a mafia boss with a legendary moustache.   The Guild runs brothels and the fight club, and anyone who wants to sell anything has to pay a ‘protection fee’.
