His position as count (or Tiarna) of Evereska also gives Antoine François Liadon the privilege of leading the Bladesinger legion as heir general. This has prepared him since childhood through the study of magic and martial arts, a training he has made all his children also follow.

After a somewhat troubled childhood, Antoine François was sent to a boarding school to learn his first steps in magic and hopefully instil something of discipline in his character. He succeeded in the magic, but the discipline, on the other hand, did not come to him until several decades later when he was forced to join the army to better prepare him for his later role.

He wears the blue uniform of a Bladesinger and is an aloof person.
