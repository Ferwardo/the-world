Albert Toussaint is the Duke (or Ard Tiarna in ancient elvish) of Chatellereau and thus also hereditary marshal of the realm. Furthermore, he is the chief of staff of the army. He is a hard-hearted person who without contradiction tries to impose his will even on the young Tánaiste [Nórimion](./Prince-Nórimion-of-Liège.md).   

His attire is the uniform or armour of a marshal.
